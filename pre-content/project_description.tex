FIXME

So based on the motivation above, the project description is as follows:

Create a development tool for C, which enables the use of CSP constructs and paradigms in normal C code. To fully utilize the potential of CSP and the inevitable increase in multicore computers, the tool should support multicore. The tool should be aimed towards development on desktop computers, which in turn excludes embedded systems. The tool should contain the following CSP constructs:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Concurrent processes
    \item Channels
    \item Alternation structure for event handling
    \item Conditional guards for alternation
    \item Ability to express evaluations of sequential and parallel expressions
    \item Timers
\end{enumerate}
