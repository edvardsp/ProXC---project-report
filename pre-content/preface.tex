This project thesis presents the results of the project work, affiliated with the course \texttt{TTK4550} from Department of Engineering Cybertnertics (\texttt{ITK}) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (\texttt{NTNU}). The project work was carried out during the autumn semester in 2016, starting in August and ending in December.

The majority of the work has gone in the implementation of the library, especially how the coroutine context switching was implemented. I hope this thesis reflects this.

The reader is expected to have basic knowledge within programming and concurrency. Having experience with programming in C will help as well.

I'd like to thank both of my supervisors, Sverre Hendseth and Ã˜yvind Teigseth, for great feedback and knowledge regarding concurrent system design and paradigms, and for enjoyable and interesting academic evenings at Solsiden. Also, extra thanks to Sverre for being patient and helping me with questions and advice regarding the writing process of this thesis.\\[2cm]
